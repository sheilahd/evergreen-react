This is a One Page Website for Evergreen HOA. The idea came alive as a Final Project for my JavaScript/React Bootcamp, and it will help my neighbors at Evergreen HOA to stay connected and share information and paperwork.
The Website is right now on Testing by the HOA Board and it will be use by the neighborhood.
I am using React JS and Firebase for  Management of the database.
The website is deployed to Heroku, visit at (https://evergreen-react.herokuapp.com/).
